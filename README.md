# cURL Browser ![Chrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alrra/browser-logos/main/src/chrome/chrome_24x24.png "Chrome") 
#### Description:

Welcome to the cURL Browser Impersonator project! This specialized tool build of [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) aims to mimic the behavior of major web browsers, such as Chrome, during TLS and HTTP handshakes. This version of cURL is wrapped in Python, allowing you to conveniently test and interact with it in a browser environment while capturing and analyzing responses.

### Key Features

- <span style="background-color:#007bff;color:#ffffff;">**Browser Emulation:**</span> This custom cURL build replicates the TLS and HTTP handshake behaviors of popular web browsers, providing an invaluable tool for studying web communication protocols and security measures.

- <span style="background-color:#28a745;color:#ffffff;">**Python Integration:**</span> By wrapping cURL in Python, you can easily create scripts and applications to test web services, APIs, and websites while leveraging the power and flexibility of Python for analysis and automation.

- <span style="background-color:#17a2b8;color:#ffffff;">**Browser Testing:**</span> Emulate user agent strings, request headers, and other browser-specific settings to test how web servers and applications respond to different client behaviors.

- <span style="background-color:#ffc107;color:#000000;">**Capture and Analyze Responses:**</span> With Python integration, you can capture and analyze HTTP responses, enabling detailed examination of web interactions and debugging.

## Basic Usage - Web Form

1. <span style="background-color:#007bff;color:#ffffff;">**Access the cURL Browser Impersonator Web Interface:**</span>

   Start by opening your web browser and navigating to the cURL Browser Impersonator web interface. The URL to access the interface should be provided by your project setup.

2. <span style="background-color:#28a745;color:#ffffff;">**Enter the URL:**</span>

   You will typically find a form field labeled "URL" or similar on the web interface. Enter the URL that you want to test or analyze in this field.

3. <span style="background-color:#17a2b8;color:#ffffff;">**Configure Browser Settings (Optional):**</span>

   Depending on your project's capabilities, you may have options to configure browser-specific settings such as user agents, request headers, and more. Adjust these settings if necessary.

4. <span style="background-color:#ffc107;color:#000000;">**Submit the Form:**</span>

   Once you have entered the URL and configured any additional settings, click the "Submit" or "Execute" button on the web form.

5. <span style="background-color:#28a745;color:#ffffff;">**Receive JSON Response:**</span>

   After submitting the form, the cURL Browser Impersonator will perform the requested action (e.g., making a request to the specified URL) and return a JSON response. This response may contain data related to the web request, including headers, content, and other relevant information.

6. <span style="background-color:#17a2b8;color:#ffffff;">**Analyze and Use the JSON Response:**</span>

   You can analyze and use the JSON response data according to your project's requirements. This may involve further processing, displaying the data, or integrating it with other tools or applications.

7. <span style="background-color:#ffc107;color:#000000;">**Contribute and Explore:**</span>

   If you encounter issues or have suggestions for improvements, consider contributing to the project. Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

Please note that the specific steps and options in the web form may vary based on your project's implementation. Make sure to provide clear instructions based on your project's user interface and functionality.

Feel free to customize this section further to match the specifics of your project's web-based interaction.

## Expected result

Listing containers must show one container running and the port mapping as below:
```
$ docker compose ps
NAME                COMMAND             SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
backend-web-1         "python3 app.py"    web                 running             0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser or run:
```
$ curl localhost:8000
Hello World!
```

Stop and remove the containers
```
$ docker compose down
```
